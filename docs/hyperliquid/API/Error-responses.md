# Error responses

Order and cancel errors are usually returned as a vector with same length as the batched request.

Below is a list of possible batched error responses:

| Error source | Error type                        | Error string                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Order        | Tick                              | Price must be divisible by tick size.                                              |
| Order        | MinTradeNtl                       | Order must have minimum value of $10.                                              |
| Order        | MinTradeSpotNtl                   | Order must have minimum value of 10 {quote\_token}.                                |
| Order        | PerpMargin                        | Insufficient margin to place order.                                                |
| Order        | ReduceOnly                        | Reduce only order would increase position.                                         |
| Order        | BadAloPx                          | Post only order would have immediately matched, bbo was {bbo}.                     |
| Order        | IocCancel                         | Order could not immediately match against any resting orders.                      |
| Order        | BadTriggerPx                      | Invalid TP/SL price.                                                               |
| Order        | MarketOrderNoLiquidity            | No liquidity available for market order.                                           |
| Order        | PositionIncreaseAtOpenInterestCap | Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped                   |
| Order        | PositionFlipAtOpenInterestCap     | Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped                   |
| Order        | TooAggressiveAtOpenInterestCap    | Order rejected due to price more aggressive than oracle while at open interest cap |
| Order        | OpenInterestIncrease              | Order would increase open interest too quickly                                     |
| Order        | InsufficientSpotBalance           | (Spot-only) Order has insufficient spot balance to trade                           |
| Order        | Oracle                            | Order price too far from oracle                                                    |
| Order        | PerpMaxPosition                   | Order would cause position to exceed margin tier limit at current leverage         |
| Cancel       | MissingOrder                      | Order was never placed, already canceled, or filled.                               |

Important: Some errors are a deterministic function of the payload itself, and these are instead returned earlier as part of pre-validation. In this case only one error is returned for the entire payload, as some of these errors do not apply to a specific order or cancel.

Examples include: empty batch of orders, non-reduce-only TP/SL orders, and some forms of tick size validation.&#x20;

For API users that use batching, it's recommended to handle the case where a single error is returned for a batch of multiple orders. In this case, the response could be duplicated `n`times before being sent to the callback function, as the whole batch was rejected for this same reason.

For API users that use historical orders, a list of all the cancel / reject historical order statuses can be found [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/info-endpoint#query-order-status-by-oid-or-cloid).
