You can also use the API via the Hyperliquid Python SDK: [https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk)

There is also a Rust SDK (although it is less maintained): [https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-rust-sdk](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-rust-sdk)

There are also Typescript SDKs written by members of the community:
[https://github.com/nktkas/hyperliquid](https://github.com/nktkas/hyperliquid) [https://github.com/nomeida/hyperliquid](https://github.com/nomeida/hyperliquid)

CCXT also maintains integrations in multiple languages that conforms with the standard CCXT API: [https://docs.ccxt.com/#/exchanges/hyperliquid](https://docs.ccxt.com/#/exchanges/hyperliquid)

All example API calls use the Mainnet url (https://api.hyperliquid.xyz), but you can make the same requests against Testnet using the corresponding url (https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz)
